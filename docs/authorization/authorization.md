## Authifi OAuth Client Authorization

As an [Authorization Server](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.1), Authifi provides layered authorization options for [OAuth Clients](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2), [Resource Servers](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.1) (APIs), and `Users` registered to the system.

### User Groups and AD Groups

Each Authifi `Tenant` can define `User Groups` and assign/remove `Users` and/or `OAuth2 Clients` to each one
. When a `User Group` is assigned to an `OAuth Client`, access to the `OAuth Client` will be restricted to the `User(s)` within the `User Group(s)` assigned to the `Client(s)`.

#### How to restrict Client access with User Groups configured via the Authifi UI

Initial steps

- Login to the Authifi UI
- View/create a `Tenant`

##### Adding Users to a Tenant

`Users` assigned to a Authifi `Tenant` can be added to the `Tenant`'s `User Groups`.

- Go to the `Users` dashboard via the left navigation menu
- Click the `Add User` button
- Add `Users` to the `Tenant` by email address

_Note: New `Users` will only display an email address in the `Users` dashboard columns until they login for the first time. This is due to Authifi brokering identities from third parties like Google rather than storing them in its own database._

##### Creating a User Group

- Go to the `User Groups` dashboard via the left navigation menu
- Click the `Add Group` button
- Specify the group name and description. Existing users can be assigned to the group before it is created.

##### Assigning/removing User Groups to OAuth Clients

- Go to the `Applications Dashboard` via the left navigation menu
- Select an existing `OAuth Client`
- In the edit dialog for the `OAuth Client`, go to the `Groups` tab
- Assign/remove `User Groups` to the `OAuth Client`

#### How to restrict OAuth Client access by AD Group membership

One or more Active Directory groups can be assigned to `OAuth Clients` in order to restrict access to members of the AD Group(s).
Currently, it is only possible to obtain AD Group information when logging in with specific Identity Providers. For example, the `Google OAuth` and `Azure OIDC` IdP does not provide AD Group information.

##### Assigning AD Groups to SAML2 OAuth Clients

- Go to the `Applications Dashboard` via the left navigation menu
- Select an existing `saml2` application or create a new one
- In the configuration editor, provide the `adGroups` attribute with a list of one or more AD Groups.

Example

```json
{
  "adGroups": ["My AD Group", "My Second AD Group"]
}
```

##### Assigning AD Groups to Web/Native OAuth Clients

- Go to the `Applications Dashboard` via the left navigation menu
- Select an existing `web` or `native` application or create a new one
- In the configuration editor, fill in the AD Group text box a list of one or more AD Groups separated by commas or newlines.

### API Authorization

#### Registering an API (Resource Server)

- Go to the `APIs Dashboard` via the left navigation menu
- Click the "Add API" button
- Specify the `name` and unique `identifier` (the `API`'s audience)
- Optionally authorize `Clients` to access the `API`. The list of `Clients` authorized to access the `API` can be changed after the `API` is registered.

#### Resource Server Client Grants

Authorize `OAuth Clients` to access a specific `API` (Resource Server).

- Go to the `APIs Dashboard` via the left navigation menu
- Select an existing `API`
- In the edit dialog for the `API`, go to the `Clients` tab
- Assign/remove `Clients` to the `API`

### Role Based Access Control

A `Role` is a grouping of a set of permissions (Resource Scopes).
Roles can be assigned to one or more `User Groups` and each `Role` can be assigned one or more `Permissions`. `Permissions` define granular, `API`-level access control. For example: `facility.users.createFacility`. These will be populated in authenticated `User's` Bearer tokens under the `scope` claim. The `scope` claim can then be verified by the service receiving a request.

Use `Roles` to group low-level `Permissions` into reusable mappings. Similarly, use `User Groups` to group `Roles` into reusable mappings for a set of users.

### Identity Assurance Levels

When authorizing, the `acr_values` query parameter can be used to request additional levels of identity assurance when authenticating the user. Currently, Authifi supports the following ACR values:

| ACR Value                                              | Short Name | Details                               |
| :----------------------------------------------------- | :--------: | :------------------------------------ |
| http://schemas.openid.net/policies/modrna/multi-factor |   mod-mf   | Requests multi-factor authentication. |

The list of supported `acr_values` can also be viewed at the OIDC Discovery URL for each tenant under the `acr_values_supported` attribute.

## Example

`/_api/auth/<tenant>/authorize?acr_values=mod-mf&...`

When providing the `mod-mf` query parameter, the user will be prompted for multi-factor authentication even if the application or identity provider does not already require it. This functionally can be used to provide an additional layer of security for more sensitive sections in an application.

Note:
If the user is already authenticated, use the "prompt" query parameter with a value of "login" to request MFA. For details on the "prompt" query parameter, refer to the [OIDC Specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html). For example: `/_api/auth/<tenant>/authorize?acr_values=mod-mf&prompt=login...`.

After successfully authenticating with MFA, the user's `id_token` and user profile will contain additional claims specifying the type of authentication used (AMR values). See: [AMR specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8176).

| AMR Value | Details                                          |
| :-------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| pwd       | Denotes username/password authentication.        |
| mfa       | Represents the use of MFA during authentication. |

For example, if the user used both a username and password and MFA during authentication, then the `amr` claim would be `['pwd', 'mfa']`.
