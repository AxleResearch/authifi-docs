## Admin roles and privileged access (Authifi service)

This document describes how the Authifi service models "admin" privileges and where those privileges come from:

- **Super Administrators** (platform-wide)
- **Tenant Administrators** (tenant-wide)
- **Scoped Administrators** (users granted elevated `ADMIN_SCOPE.*` permissions)

It complements the detailed operation inventory in [Super Admin Access](super-admin-access.md).

---

### Terminology Note

In user-facing documentation, the platform-wide admin role is called **"Super Administrator"** to distinguish it from infrastructure system administrators who manage servers and operating systems.

## Super Administrators

**What it means**

- Super Administrators have platform-wide privileged access across all tenants.

**How it is determined**

- Super Administrator status is determined by membership in the designated Super Administrator group (configured via `auth.defaults.systemAdminGroup`).
- When a user authenticates, the system checks their group membership and sets an internal authorization flag accordingly.

**What it enables**

- Super Administrators can perform platform-wide privileged operations and are often treated as a bypass for limits and checks.
- Some actions are **still blocked even for Super Administrators** (e.g., certain protections around config-defined Super Administrators).
- See [Super Admin Access](super-admin-access.md) for a comprehensive list of SA-only/SA-or-scope operations.

---

## Tenant Administrators

**What it means**

- Tenant Administrators are treated as "full admin within a tenant" for most tenant-scoped APIs.

**How it is determined**

- Tenant Administrator status is determined by membership in the tenant's admin group (configured via `auth.defaults.adminGroup`).

**What it enables**

- **Within a tenant**, Tenant Administrators are generally able to perform tenant admin actions, except where an operation is explicitly restricted to Super Administrators or to an elevated admin scope.
- Tenant Administrators are also used in **cross-tenant authorization** via "trusted tenants" delegation (see below).

---

## Scoped Administrators (admin scopes)

**What it means**

- "Scoped Administrators" are users who are not necessarily Super Administrators, but have elevated permissions via `ADMIN_SCOPE.*` scopes.

**How it is determined**

- Scopes come from the user's permissions/roles and are evaluated at request time.
- These scopes are assigned through role-based access control (RBAC) configuration.

**What it enables**

- These scopes commonly grant access to operations that would otherwise be **Super-Administrator-only** (or allow edits on "privileged" entities).
- Examples of elevated admin scopes used in Authifi:
    - `ADMIN_SCOPE.ADMIN_PERMISSIONS_UPDATE` (privileged RBAC entities: admin groups/roles/permissions)
    - `ADMIN_SCOPE.UPDATE_SYSTEM_TEMPLATES` (system templates)
    - `ADMIN_SCOPE.TRUSTED_PROVIDER_EDIT` (trusted/verified IdP restrictions, some IdP type restrictions)
    - `ADMIN_SCOPE.IDENTITY_PROVIDER_CLAIMS_SCRIPTING` (IdP claims mapping scripting)
    - `ADMIN_SCOPE.UPDATE_ACCESS_SCRIPTS` / `ADMIN_SCOPE.UPDATE_CLIENTS` (client scripting / client updates)
    - `ADMIN_SCOPE.IDENTITY_PROVIDER_SECRETS_LIST` (unmask IdP secrets in responses)
    - `ADMIN_SCOPE.USER_SSH_SECRET` (SSH key operations)

For the exact places these are enforced, see the relevant sections in [Super Admin Access](super-admin-access.md).

---

## How these roles are enforced

### 1) API-level authorization checks

- Many API endpoints explicitly check Super Administrator status, Tenant Administrator status, and/or specific `ADMIN_SCOPE.*` permissions.
- Example patterns:
    - **SA-only**: Request is rejected unless the user is a Super Administrator
    - **SA-or-scope**: Super Administrator is allowed, otherwise requires an `ADMIN_SCOPE.*`
    - **SA-or-tenant-admin**: Super Administrator is allowed, otherwise allows Tenant Administrators

### 2) Admin override for scope failures

- A large portion of `/auth/admin/tenants/{tenantId}/...` endpoints are primarily protected by **OAuth scopes**.
- When authentication fails due to `Insufficient scope`, the authorization system can allow certain admin users to proceed:
    - Tenant Administrator of the **target tenant** (`{tenantId}`), or
    - Tenant Administrator of the **original token tenant** _and_ the target tenant is a **trusted tenant**.
- This bypass is not applied to **Client Credentials** tokens.

This is why many "admin" APIs don't contain an explicit "Tenant Administrator required" check: Tenant Administrators may still be able to use them even when scopes are missing.

### 3) Trusted tenants delegation

- The service supports delegating admin access across tenants using "trusted tenants" relationships.
- See [Trusted Tenant Implementation](trusted-tenant-implementation.md) for details.

---

## Common patterns and examples

- **Tenant Administrators can do "anything in the tenant", except what is SA-only or scope-gated**
    - Practically, Tenant Administrators can perform most tenant administration, but some operations remain reserved for:
        - **Super Administrators** (SA-only), or
        - **Scoped Administrators** (SA-or-scope), especially around privileged RBAC entities and sensitive scripting/secrets.

- **Privileged RBAC entities** (admin groups/roles/permissions)
    - Commonly enforced as **SA-or-scope** (`ADMIN_SCOPE.ADMIN_PERMISSIONS_UPDATE`).

- **Trusted identity provider controls**
    - Commonly enforced as **SA-or-scope** (`ADMIN_SCOPE.TRUSTED_PROVIDER_EDIT`), with additional Tenant-Administrator-specific logic for some IdP fields.

- **Monitoring / reporting APIs**
    - Often scope-gated (e.g. audit/log scopes, protected health scope), with Tenant Administrator access potentially enabled via the admin override mechanism.

## Securing admin accounts (best practices)

- **Prefer "trusted" identity providers for admin identities**
    - Restrict admin sign-in to identity providers that are verified/trusted and centrally managed.
    - Avoid granting admin access to accounts authenticated via ad-hoc or weakly verified providers.

- **Enforce MFA for all admin-capable accounts**
    - Require phishing-resistant MFA where possible (e.g. WebAuthn/FIDO2), at minimum TOTP.
    - Ensure "break-glass" admin accounts are also MFA-protected (with tightly controlled recovery).

- **Apply least privilege and minimize standing access**
    - Keep the number of **Super Administrators** small.
    - Prefer **scoped admin access** (`ADMIN_SCOPE.*`) over Super Administrator where possible.
    - Remove unused admin scopes; time-bound or approval-gated elevation where feasible.

- **Separate admin and day-to-day user accounts**
    - Use dedicated admin accounts for privileged actions.
    - Do not browse email/drive/chat from privileged accounts; reduce exposure to phishing and token theft.

- **Review admin access regularly**
    - Periodically review:
        - Super Administrator assignments,
        - Tenant Administrator group membership,
        - users holding `ADMIN_SCOPE.*` privileges,
        - "trusted tenant" delegations.
    - Treat emergency additions as temporary and require follow-up removal/review.

- **Monitor and audit admin activity**
    - Audit logs should be routinely reviewed for privileged actions (RBAC changes, secrets access, IdP changes, template/script changes, tenant exports).
    - Alert on anomalous admin behavior (new admin grants, repeated denied attempts, unusual login patterns, cross-tenant access via delegation).

- **Harden sessions and tokens**
    - Shorter session lifetimes for admin contexts; revoke sessions promptly on role removal.
    - Rotate credentials/secrets used by admin automation; avoid long-lived tokens.

- **Have an incident-ready process**
    - Document how to revoke admin access quickly (including removing scopes, disabling accounts, revoking sessions).
    - Validate restore/recovery paths for audit logs and configuration (and restrict restore operations appropriately).
