## Overview

The **Access Requests** section enables self-service and delegated access management:

- **Self-service access**: Users request access; approvers grant or deny
- **Delegated administration**: Empower non-admins to manage specific resources
- **Time-limited access**: Automatic expiration for temporary permissions
- **Audit trail**: Complete record of access grants and approvals
- **Bulk operations**: Efficiently onboard groups of users

**Security philosophy**: Access Requests implements the principle of least standing privilege by enabling:

- Just-in-time access (request when needed, not granted permanently)
- Time-limited grants (automatic expiration)
- Peer approval (non-admin managers can approve)
- Self-service (reduces admin bottlenecks)

---

## Access Requests Menu Options

### View Access Requests

**Location**: Access Requests > View Access Requests

**Purpose**: Central dashboard for viewing, creating, approving, and rejecting access requests.

#### What you can do

- **View all access requests**: See pending, approved, and rejected requests
- **Create access requests**: Submit new requests on behalf of users
- **Review requests**: Examine request details before approval
- **Approve requests**: Grant access to approved requests
- **Reject requests**: Deny access with reason
- **Filter and search**: Find specific requests by user, status, date range, or resource

#### Request Table Columns

- **Access Request Name**: The template name for this request
- **User**: Email of user requesting access
- **Resource ID**: Identifier of the requested resource
- **Request Date**: When request was submitted
- **Expired**: Whether the request has expired
- **Request Expiration Date**: When request expires if not approved
- **Status**: `pending`, `approved`, or `rejected`
- **Details**: Click to view full request details and take action

#### Filtering Access Requests

**Status filter**:

- **Pending**: Awaiting approval
- **Approved**: Access has been granted
- **Rejected**: Access was denied
- **Any**: Show all requests

**Expiration filter**:

- **Expired**: Requests past their approval deadline
- **Not Expired**: Active requests still awaitable approval
- **Any**: Show all

**Date range filter**:

- Filter by request creation date
- Presets: Today, Yesterday, Last 7/30 days, This/Last Month
- Custom range: Select start and end dates

**Search**: Free-text search across request name, user, and access type

#### Request Lifecycle

1. **Submitted**: User or admin creates an access request
2. **Pending**: Request awaits approval from authorized approver
3. **Approved**: Approver grants access
   - User/group is added to target group or granted UMRS role
   - Access becomes active immediately
4. **Rejected**: Approver denies access
   - No permissions granted
   - User notified of rejection
5. **Expired**: Request deadline passed without approval
   - Request cannot be approved after expiration
   - User must submit a new request

#### Creating an Access Request

1. Click **+ ADD NEW** button
2. Select user who needs access
3. Choose access template (pre-configured by admin)
4. Provide justification (optional)
5. Submit request
6. Request appears in pending state for approvers

**Use case**: Admin creates request on behalf of user who doesn't have self-service access.

#### Approving/Rejecting Requests

1. Click **Details** icon on a pending request
2. Review request details:
   - Who is requesting
   - What access they need
   - Why (justification)
   - When requested
3. Click **Approve** or **Reject**
4. Optionally provide comment
5. Access is granted/denied immediately

**Security recommendations**:

- Review justification before approving
- Verify requester's identity through separate channel for sensitive access
- Document approval decision in comment field
- Set up approval workflows requiring multiple approvers for high-privilege access
- Monitor for unusual request patterns (bulk requests, repeated rejections)

---

### Request Templates

**Location**: Access Requests > Request Templates

**Purpose**: Define pre-configured access request templates that users can self-service request.

#### What you can do

- **View templates**: See all configured access request templates
- **Create templates**: Define new requestable access patterns
- **Edit templates**: Update template configuration
- **Delete templates**: Remove unused templates

#### Template Types

**RBAC Group Access**:

- User requests membership in a specific group
- Upon approval, user is added to the group
- User inherits all group roles and permissions
- **Use case**: "Request Developer Access" → adds user to "developers" group

**Resource Access (UMRS)**:

- User requests a specific UMRS role on a resource
- Upon approval, user gets role grant on that resource
- Supports resource-level access control
- **Use case**: "Request Project Alpha Access" → grants "viewer" role on "project-alpha" resource

**RBAC Group Extension Request**:

- User requests to extend their membership in a group they're already in
- Prevents automatic removal upon expiration
- **Use case**: Contractor extends "external-developers" membership for another quarter

**Resource Extension Request (UMRS)**:

- User requests to extend their UMRS role grant
- Extends expiration date on existing grant
- **Use case**: Project team member extends access beyond initial timeframe

#### Template Table Columns

- **Access Request Name**: Template display name
- **Application**: Associated client application (optional)
- **Target Resource**: What access this grants (group name or UMRS role)
- **Settings**: Edit template configuration
- **Delete**: Remove template

#### Creating a Template

1. Click **+ ADD NEW** dropdown
2. Select template type:
   - **RBAC Group Access**: Group membership request
   - **Resource Access**: UMRS role grant request
   - **RBAC Group Extension Request**: Extend group membership
   - **Resource Extension Request**: Extend UMRS grant
3. Configure template (see [Request Template Configuration](#request-template-configuration))
4. Click **Save**

**Security recommendations**:

- Create templates only for access that should be self-serviceable
- Require approval for all sensitive access (don't use auto-approval)
- Set appropriate expiration times for approval windows
- Use clear, descriptive template names
- Document approval workflow in template description

---

### User-Managed Roles (UMRS)

**Location**: Access Requests > User-Managed Roles

**Purpose**: Define roles that designated managers can grant without being full admins.

**What is UMRS?**

User-Managed Role System (UMRS) enables **delegated administration**:

- Project leads can grant project-specific access
- Team managers can control team resource access
- Non-admins can manage access to resources they own
- Reduces admin bottleneck for routine access grants

#### What you can do

- **View UMRS roles**: See all user-managed roles
- **Create UMRS roles**: Define new delegated roles
- **Edit UMRS roles**: Update role configuration
- **Delete UMRS roles**: Remove unused roles
- **Configure managers**: Designate who can grant this role

#### UMRS Role Table Columns

- **Name**: Role identifier
- **Description**: Role purpose
- **Resource Server**: API/resource this role applies to
- **Settings**: Edit role configuration
- **Delete**: Remove role

#### Creating a UMRS Role

1. Click **+ ADD User Role**
2. Configure role:
   - **Name\***: Unique role identifier
   - **Description\***: What this role grants access to
   - **Managers Group\***: Group whose members can grant this role
   - **Resource Server\***: API or resource this role controls
   - **Allow Grant Extension Requests**: Users can request to extend their grants
3. Click **Save**

**Example configuration**:

```
Name: project-alpha-viewer
Description: View-only access to Project Alpha resources
Managers Group: project-alpha-leads
Resource Server: Project Management API
Allow Grant Extension Requests: Yes
```

**Result**: Members of "project-alpha-leads" group can grant "project-alpha-viewer" role to users without needing full admin privileges.

#### UMRS vs. Regular Roles

| Feature           | Regular Roles | UMRS Roles          |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| **Who can grant** | Admins only   | Designated managers |
| **Scope**         | Tenant-wide   | Resource-specific   |
| **Expiration**    | Permanent     | Can be time-limited |
| **Extension**     | N/A           | Can allow requests  |
| **Delegation**    | No            | Yes                 |

**Use cases**:

1. **Project-based access**: Project managers control project resource access
2. **Team resources**: Team leads manage team-specific tools
3. **Departmental apps**: Department heads grant access to department resources
4. **Customer resources**: Account managers control customer data access

**Security benefits**:

- Reduces admin workload for routine access grants
- Empowers domain experts to manage their resources
- Maintains audit trail of who granted what
- Enables fine-grained, resource-level access control

---

### Access Grants

**Location**: Access Requests > Access Grants

**Purpose**: View and manage all UMRS role grants (user-to-role and group-to-role assignments for UMRS roles).

**Dashboard structure**: Two tabs:

1. **User Grants**: Individual user assignments to UMRS roles
2. **Group Grants**: Group assignments to UMRS roles

#### User Grants Tab

**What you can see**:

- **Resource Server**: API or resource
- **Resource**: Specific resource instance (e.g., "project-123")
- **Role**: UMRS role granted
- **User**: User who has this grant
- **Expires**: Expiration date (or "never")
- **Settings**: Edit expiration
- **Delete**: Revoke grant

**What you can do**:

- **Add user to role**: Click **+ ADD User to Role**
  - Select UMRS role
  - Select user
  - Set resource ID
  - Set expiration date (optional)
  - User immediately gets access
- **Edit expiration**: Click **Settings** icon
  - Update expiration date
  - Extend or shorten access duration
- **Revoke grant**: Click **Delete** icon
  - Remove user's access immediately
  - User loses role-based permissions

#### Group Grants Tab

**What you can see**:

- **Resource Server**: API or resource
- **Resource**: Specific resource instance
- **Role**: UMRS role granted to group
- **Group**: Group that has this grant
- **Expires**: Expiration date (or "never")
- **Settings**: Edit expiration
- **Delete**: Revoke grant

**What you can do**:

- **Add group to role**: Click **+ ADD Group to Role**
  - Select UMRS role
  - Select group
  - Set resource ID
  - Set expiration date (optional)
  - All group members immediately get access
- **Edit expiration**: Update group grant expiration
- **Revoke grant**: Remove group's access

#### User Grants vs. Group Grants

**Use user grants when**:

- Individual user needs exceptional access
- One-off access requirement
- Temporary access for specific person

**Use group grants when**:

- Multiple users need same access
- Access aligns with organizational structure (team, project)
- Recurring pattern (many people will need this over time)

**Best practice**: Prefer group grants over individual user grants for maintainability and scalability.

**Security recommendations**:

- Set expiration dates for all grants (avoid permanent grants)
- Review grants quarterly and remove unnecessary access
- Monitor for grants that never expire
- Use shortest reasonable expiration period
- Require re-approval for extensions

#### Invitation Workflow

**Without confirmation**:

1. Invitation is created
2. Email is sent to user
3. User is automatically added to group
4. User can access group resources immediately

**With confirmation required**:

1. Invitation is created
2. Email is sent with confirmation link
3. User clicks link and sees confirmation page
4. User is added to group after confirmation
5. User can access group resources

**Expiration behavior**:

- Invitation expires after specified time
- Expired invitations cannot be accepted
- Must create new invitation if expired

**Membership expiration**:

- If set, user's group membership expires on specified date
- User is automatically removed from group at expiration
- User can request extension if group allows extension requests

**Use cases**:

1. **Onboarding**: Invite new employees to "employees" group
2. **Project teams**: Invite contractors to "project-x-contractors" group with expiration
3. **Temporary access**: Invite auditors to "auditors" group for limited time
4. **Self-service**: Allow users to accept invitations without admin intervention

**Security recommendations**:

- Set reasonable expiration times (1-7 days for invitations)
- Use confirmation for sensitive group invitations
- Set membership expiration for temporary access
- Monitor for expired invitations and clean up
- Require identity issuer for non-existing users to prevent wrong IdP selection

### SSH Secrets

**Location**: Access Requests > SSH Secrets

**Purpose**: Generate SSH access credentials for users to access remote servers or command-line interfaces.

**Availability**: Requires `auth.admin.usersshsecret` scope (elevated permission).

#### What you can do

- **Create SSH access**: Generate SSH key pair and configuration for a user
- **Download credentials**: Receive JSON file with SSH private key, public key, and connection details

#### Creating SSH Access

1. Navigate to **SSH Secrets** dashboard
2. Fill in the form:
   - **User Email\***: Search and select the user who needs SSH access
     - Autocomplete searches across all tenant users
     - Shows email, name, and identity issuer
   - **SSH Server\***: Hostname or IP of the SSH server
     - Example: `ssh.example.com`, `10.0.1.50`
   - **SSH Username\***: Username for SSH login
     - Example: `ubuntu`, `ec2-user`, user's system username
3. Click **Create SSH Secret**
4. JSON file downloads automatically with credentials

#### Downloaded Credentials Format

```json
{
  "userId": 123,
  "userEmail": "user@example.com",
  "sshServer": "ssh.example.com",
  "sshUsername": "ubuntu",
  "publicKey": "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EA...",
  "privateKey": "-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\n...",
  "sshConfig": "Host ssh.example.com\n  User ubuntu\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/auth_rsa"
}
```

#### Installing SSH Credentials (User Instructions)

**For users receiving SSH access**:

1. Save the `privateKey` to `~/.ssh/auth_rsa`
2. Set permissions: `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/auth_rsa`
3. Add public key to authorized_keys on server (admin task) or use provided config
4. Connect: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/auth_rsa ubuntu@ssh.example.com`

**Server-side setup** (requires server admin):

```bash
# Add user's public key to authorized_keys
echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EA..." >> /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

**Security warnings**:

⚠️ **Critical**: The downloaded private key cannot be retrieved again. If lost, generate new credentials.

⚠️ **Secret material**: Treat downloaded JSON as highly sensitive (contains private key)

⚠️ **One-time download**: Securely transmit to user or have user generate in self-service portal

**Security recommendations**:

- **Rotate SSH keys regularly** (every 90-180 days)
- **Audit SSH key creation** (elevated privilege operation)
- **Secure private key storage**: Use password-protected key files or SSH agent
- **Revoke unused keys**: Delete from server's `authorized_keys` when no longer needed
- **Set key expiration**: Implement key expiration policies on SSH servers
- **Monitor SSH access logs**: Track who accesses what via SSH
- **Use separate keys per server**: Don't reuse keys across environments
- **Require strong passphrases**: If possible, generate password-protected keys

#### Batch Processing

**Lifecycle**:

1. **Submitted**: Batch job created and queued
2. **Processing**: System sends invitations sequentially
3. **Completed**: All invitations processed (may include some failures)
4. **Failed**: Batch job encountered fatal error

**Monitoring progress**:

- Click **Success/Failure/Pending** counts to see specific invitations
- Click **Details** to view full batch configuration and all results
- **Copy** button allows repeating similar batch operations

**Handling failures**:

- Review failure details (invalid email, user already in group, quota exceeded)
- Fix issues and create new batch for failed entries
- Check logs for systematic issues

#### Batch Invite JSON Format

```json
[
  "alice@example.com",
  "bob@example.com",
  "charlie@example.com",

]
```

**Validation**: JSON must be an array of strings (email addresses).

**Use cases**:

1. **Class enrollment**: Invite 50 students to "course-2025-spring" group
2. **Department onboarding**: Add 20 new hires to "engineering" group
3. **Event access**: Grant 100 attendees access to "conference-2025" group
4. **Partner onboarding**: Invite partner organization users to collaboration group

**Best practices**:

- Test with small batch first (2-3 users) before large operations
- Use meaningful descriptions (e.g., "Q1 2025 Intern Onboarding")
- Monitor batch progress for failures
- Keep batch sizes reasonable (< 1000 users per batch)
- Have email addresses validated before batching
- Use confirmation for new users, skip for existing users

**Security recommendations**:

- Verify email list before submission (avoid typos)
- Ensure all recipients should actually get this access
- Use group expiration for temporary batch access
- Audit batch operations regularly (powerful capability)
- Limit who can create batch invites (consider requiring approval)

## Request Template Configuration

### RBAC Group Access Template

**Purpose**: Allow users to request membership in a specific group.

#### Configuration Fields

- **Requested Group\***
  - The group users will be added to upon approval
  - Autocomplete search with filtering
  - Shows group name and description
  - **Create Group button**: Quick-create group if it doesn't exist

- **Request Template Display Name\***
  - User-facing name for this access request option
  - Example: "Request Developer Access", "QA Environment Access"
  - Should clearly describe what access is granted

- **Inviter/Approver Group\***
  - Group whose members can approve requests
  - Members of this group receive approval notifications
  - Can invite others directly (bypass request workflow)
  - **Create Group button**: Quick-create approver group if needed

- **Accept/Approve Within\***
  - Deadline for approval
  - After this time, request expires and cannot be approved
  - Units: days or minutes
  - Example: 7 days, 1440 minutes (1 day)
  - **Security note**: Shorter windows reduce exposure of pending requests

- **Invitation Email Template\***
  - Email template used when sending invitation/approval emails
  - Select from configured email templates
  - Should include:
    - What access is being granted
    - How to accept or request
    - Expiration information

- **Client Application**
  - Associate this template with a specific application (optional)
  - Helps users understand what app they're getting access to
  - Used for audit and reporting

- **Description**
  - Internal description of template purpose
  - Not shown to requesters
  - **Use case**: Document approval requirements, escalation paths

**Example template**:

```
Template Display Name: Request Production Database Access
Requested Group: production-db-users
Approver Group: database-administrators
Accept/Approve Within: 3 days
Email Template: Standard Access Request
Client Application: Production DB Management Portal
Description: Grants read-only access to production databases. Requires DBA approval. Must have completed security training.
```

---

### Resource Access Template (UMRS)

**Purpose**: Allow users to request UMRS role grants on specific resources.

#### Configuration Fields

Similar to RBAC template, plus:

- **UMRS Role\***
  - Select from configured UMRS roles
  - Determines what permissions are granted
- **Resource Scope**
  - Whether user can specify resource ID
  - Or template is for a specific pre-defined resource

**Use case**: "Request Project Access" where users specify which project (resource ID) they need access to.

---

### Extension Request Templates

**Purpose**: Allow users to request extension of existing access beyond original expiration date.

**RBAC Group Extension**:

- User is already in group with expiration
- Requests to extend membership
- Approver can grant extension

**Resource Extension (UMRS)**:

- User has UMRS role grant with expiration
- Requests to extend grant
- Manager can approve extension

**Configuration**: Similar to access templates, but applied to existing grants rather than creating new ones.

**Security benefit**: Forces periodic re-approval of access, ensuring access is still appropriate.

---

## UMRS Role Configuration

### Creating a UMRS Role

Detailed explanation of each field in UMRS role creation dialog:

#### Name\*

- Unique identifier for the role
- **Format**: Use descriptive, resource-scoped names
- **Examples**:
  - `project-alpha-admin`
  - `api-orders-viewer`
  - `resource-editor`
- **Naming convention**: `<resource>-<privilege-level>`

#### Description\*

- Human-readable explanation of what this role grants
- Shown to users when requesting access
- **Examples**:
  - "Full administrative access to Project Alpha resources"
  - "View-only access to Order Management API"
  - "Edit permissions for shared resources"

#### Managers Group\*

- Group whose members can grant this role
- **Critical choice**: This delegates admin power to non-admins
- Autocomplete search with filtering
- **Security note**: Only assign manager rights to trusted groups

**Example scenario**:

```
UMRS Role: project-beta-contributor
Managers Group: project-beta-leads
Result: Members of "project-beta-leads" can grant "project-beta-contributor" role
```

#### Resource Server\*

- The API or resource system this role controls access to
- Select from configured resource servers (APIs)
- Determines what permissions this role can grant
- **Example**: "Project Management API", "Document Storage API"

#### Allow Grant Extension Requests

- Toggle to enable users to request access extensions
- When enabled, users with this role can request to extend their grant before expiration
- Managers receive extension requests for approval
- **Use case**: Project-based access where timelines may extend

**Security consideration**: Extensions should also require approval; don't allow automatic extensions.

---

## Security Best Practices

### Access Request Security

1. **Require approval for sensitive access**
   - Don't use auto-approval for privileged groups
   - Require justification in requests
   - Implement multiple-approver workflows for critical access
   - Monitor approval patterns (who approves what)

2. **Set appropriate expiration windows**
   - Short approval windows (3-7 days) for routine access
   - Longer windows (30 days) for complex approvals requiring research
   - Expire requests that aren't approved promptly
   - Clean up expired requests regularly

3. **Audit request activity**
   - Review approval patterns for abuse
   - Monitor for unusual request volumes
   - Track approver actions
   - Alert on rejected requests (may indicate attack or confusion)

4. **Validate requesters**
   - Ensure requester identity is verified
   - Check for legitimate business need
   - Verify requester is using correct IdP
   - Watch for social engineering attempts

### UMRS Security

1. **Carefully choose managers**
   - Manager groups wield delegated admin power
   - Only grant to trusted, trained individuals
   - Review manager group membership quarterly
   - Require security awareness training for managers

2. **Scope UMRS roles narrowly**
   - Create resource-specific roles, not tenant-wide
   - Limit permissions in UMRS roles to minimum required
   - Don't create overly broad UMRS roles
   - Regular roles for broad access; UMRS for specific resources

3. **Enforce time limits**
   - Always set expiration dates on UMRS grants
   - Require re-approval for extensions
   - Shorter expirations for higher-risk resources (30-90 days)
   - Longer expirations for stable team access (180-365 days)

4. **Monitor delegation**
   - Audit who is granting what access
   - Watch for managers granting to themselves
   - Alert on unusual grant patterns
   - Review grant extensions for necessity

5. **Separate privileges**
   - Don't make the same group both target and manager
   - Separate "can grant" from "has access"
   - Prevent circular delegation patterns

### Group Invitation Security

1. **Verify email addresses**
   - Double-check email lists before batch operations
   - Prevent typos that send invitations to wrong people
   - Use domain validation (e.g., only @company.com)
   - Monitor for suspicious external domains

2. **Use confirmation for new users**
   - Require invitation acceptance click
   - Prevents accidental group additions
   - Gives users visibility into what access they're getting
   - Creates audit trail of user consent

3. **Set membership expiration**
   - Use for contractors, consultants, temporary staff
   - Review and re-approve before extension
   - Automatic cleanup when period ends
   - Reduces orphaned access

4. **Monitor invitation abuse**
   - Track who is sending invitations
   - Alert on large batch operations
   - Review expired invitations (may indicate incorrect emails)
   - Watch for invitation spam patterns

### SSH Access Security

1. **Treat as highly privileged**
   - SSH access is powerful (terminal access)
   - Require elevated admin scope for creation
   - Limit who can generate SSH credentials
   - Audit all SSH key generations

2. **Secure private keys**
   - Transmitted once (in download)
   - User must protect private key
   - Consider password-protecting keys
   - Use SSH agent for key management

3. **Rotate keys**
   - Regular rotation schedule (90-180 days)
   - Immediate rotation on compromise
   - Remove old keys from servers
   - Maintain key inventory

4. **Monitor SSH usage**
   - Log SSH connections on servers
   - Alert on unusual access patterns
   - Correlate with user access grants
   - Investigate unauthorized access attempts

5. **Server-side controls**
   - Implement server-side key expiration
   - Use SSH certificate authorities for short-lived certs
   - Restrict SSH access by IP/network
   - Enable 2FA for SSH (if supported)

### Operational Security

1. **Document workflows**
   - Clear procedures for access requests
   - Approval SLAs (how quickly to respond)
   - Escalation paths for urgent requests
   - Training materials for approvers

2. **Regular reviews**
   - Weekly: Review pending requests (avoid backlog)
   - Monthly: Audit approved access grants
   - Quarterly: Review template configurations
   - Annually: Comprehensive access audit

3. **Automate where safe**
   - Low-risk access can be auto-approved
   - High-risk access requires human approval
   - Use approval rules based on group/resource sensitivity
   - Monitor automated approvals for abuse

4. **Maintain audit trail**
   - All requests logged with timestamps
   - Approver identity recorded
   - Rejection reasons documented
   - Support forensic investigation
