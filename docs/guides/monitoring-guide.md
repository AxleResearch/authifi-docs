- **Subject**: Secondary affected resource
- **ClientActor**: Application used
- **Comments**: Admin notes or justification
- **TimeStamp**: When it occurred
- **Old Entity**: Click to copy previous state
- **New Entity**: Click to copy new state
- **Diff**: View computed differences
- **Details**: Open full audit log entry

**Default view**: Last 7 days of audit logs, sorted by most recent.

#### Searching and Filtering Audit Logs

**Quick search**: Use the search bar to find logs by:

- **Action**: Search for specific action types (e.g., "update", "delete")
- **Target**: Find changes to specific resources
- **Actor**: Filter by admin email or username
- **Subject**: Search secondary affected entities
- **Comments**: Find logs with specific justifications

**Advanced search**: Click search icon to specify:

- **Field selection**: Choose which field to search
- **Date range**: Filter by time period
  - Presets: Today, Yesterday, Last 7/30 days, This/Last Month
  - Custom: Select start and end dates
- **Multiple criteria**: Combine multiple search conditions

**Natural language queries**: Enable advanced filtering with plain English:

- "action is 'update IdentityProvider' and the timestamp is from last month"
- "the actor is like example.com"
- "the target is 'test role'"

See [Natural Language Queries](#natural-language-queries) for more examples.

#### Understanding Audit Log Details

**Old Entity vs. New Entity**:

- **Old Entity**: Complete JSON snapshot of resource before change
- **New Entity**: Complete JSON snapshot after change
- **Diff**: Automatically computed differences showing only what changed

**Diff notation**:

```json
{
  "fieldName__deleted": "value that was removed",
  "fieldName__added": "value that was added",
  "fieldName": {
    "_old": "previous value",
    "_new": "current value"
  }
}
```

**Use case**: Investigate "Who changed the Google IdP configuration last week?"

- Search for Target: "Google"
- Set date range: Last 7 days
- Review Actor column to see who made changes
- Click Details to see Old Entity vs. New Entity
- Review Diff to see exactly what changed

## Natural Language Queries

**All log dashboards** support natural language queries (NLQ) for intuitive filtering.

### How to Use

- Look for **"Ask a question"** or NLQ search bar
- Type your question in plain English
- System converts to database query
- Results are filtered automatically

### Query Examples

**Audit Logs**:

- "action is 'update IdentityProvider' and the timestamp is from last month"
- "the actor is like example.com"
- "the target is 'test role'"
- "show me all delete actions from yesterday"
- "who modified the google provider last week"

**Event Logs**:

- "the event type is login and the log was created in the last 7 days"
- "client is reportmgr and the log was created one week ago"
- "show failed logins from IP xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
- "mfa events for user@example.com yesterday"
- "login events where provider is google"

**Job Logs**:

- 'the job name is "audit log trim"'
- "job type contains 'email' and status is 'failed'"
- "the job was created in the last 24 hours"
- "show running jobs older than 1 hour"

**Notification Logs**:

- "the email subject contains 'totp reset' and the timestamp is from yesterday"
- "recipient is user@example.com and status is failed"
- "category is invitation and the log was created last week"

### Query Syntax Tips

**Time expressions**:

- "from yesterday", "last week", "last month"
- "in the last 7 days", "in the last 24 hours"
- "one week ago", "two days ago"

**Comparison operators**:

- "is", "is not"
- "contains", "does not contain"
- "like", "not like" (partial matching)

**Combining conditions**:

- Use "and" to combine multiple conditions
- Example: "event type is login and created on is from last week and email is user@example.com"

**Field names**:

- Use column names from the table
- Case insensitive
- Example: "Event Type", "event type", "eventType" all work

---

## Exporting Logs

**Export formats**: JSON (complete data) or CSV (spreadsheet-compatible).

### JSON Export

**Advantages**:

- Complete data preservation (all fields)
- Machine-readable for automated processing
- Nested objects preserved
- Suitable for archiving and compliance

**Use cases**:

- Long-term audit log retention
- Compliance archiving (SOC 2, HIPAA)
- Data migration to SIEM systems
- Forensic investigation

### CSV Export

**Advantages**:

- Spreadsheet-compatible (Excel, Google Sheets)
- Human-readable format
- Easy sorting and filtering in spreadsheet
- Suitable for reporting and analysis

**Limitations**:

- Nested objects flattened or truncated
- Some field data may be simplified

**Use cases**:

- Management reporting
- Trend analysis in Excel
- Quick review and sharing
- Non-technical stakeholder reports

### Export Best Practices

- **Regular exports**:
    - Export audit logs weekly or monthly
    - Schedule exports before data retention cleanup
    - Store exports in secure, backed-up location

- **Retention compliance**:
    - Check regulatory requirements (7 years for SOC 2, etc.)
    - Export before automatic log trimming
    - Document export schedule and storage location

- **Security**:
    - Exports contain sensitive data (emails, IPs, changes)
    - Encrypt export files at rest
    - Limit access to export archives
    - Securely delete old exports per policy

- **Export size management**:
    - Limit exports to reasonable size (< 1M records)
    - Use date range filters to reduce size
    - Consider incremental exports (daily/weekly) vs. full exports

- **Verification**:
    - Test restore process for audit log archives
    - Verify export completeness (record counts)
    - Document export and restore procedures

- Export logs for weekly archive

**Monthly tasks**:

- Comprehensive Audit Log review
- Review all Grants for unused applications
- Revoke old Sessions (> 30 days)
- Verify email delivery health (Notification Logs)

### Incident Response

**Suspected account compromise**:

- **Event Logs**: Filter by user email
- Review login locations, times, devices
- Check for unusual application access
- **Sessions**: Revoke all user sessions
- **Grants**: Revoke all user grants
- **Audit Logs**: Review any changes user made
- Reset user password and require MFA

**Configuration tampering**:

- **Audit Logs**: Filter by Target (affected resource)

- Identify Actor who made change
- Verify change was authorized
- Revert unauthorized changes
- If unauthorized, investigate Actor account compromise

**Bulk operation failure**:

- **Job Logs**: Find failed job
- Review Message and Stacktrace
- Determine if data error or config error
- Fix underlying issue

    - Establish routine review schedule
    - Assign responsibility for log review

- **Alert on anomalies**:
    - Set up monitoring for unusual patterns
    - Alert on bulk deletions
    - Monitor failed login spikes
    - Watch for after-hours admin activity

- **Protect audit logs**:
    - Audit logs themselves are sensitive
    - Limit who can view audit logs
    - Prevent audit log deletion
    - Export regularly for protection against tampering

- **Document procedures**:
    - Who reviews logs and how often
    - What constitutes an incident
    - Escalation procedures
    - Export and retention procedures

- **Maintain integrity**:
    - Audit logs should be immutable
    - Export to write-once storage for compliance
    - Hash exports to prove integrity
    - Maintain chain of custody for exports
