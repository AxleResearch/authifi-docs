## Overview

The **Users and Groups** section enables you to:

- Create and manage user accounts
- Organize users into groups for access control
- Assign roles and permissions to users and groups
- Monitor and audit user access

**Security context**: User and group management is critical for maintaining least privilege access. Proper configuration ensures users have only the permissions they need while simplifying administration through group-based access control.

**Note**: For platform license management (super admins only), see the **[License Management Guide](license-management-guide.md)**.

## Security Best Practices

### User Management Security

1. **Follow least privilege**
   - Grant minimum permissions required for job function
   - Review and revoke unused permissions regularly
   - Use time-limited access for temporary needs

2. **Use group-based access control**
   - Assign permissions to groups, not individual users
   - Easier to audit and maintain
   - Reduces error-prone individual assignments

3. **Implement strong authentication**
   - Prefer passkeys (WebAuthn) over TOTP when possible
   - Require MFA for admin and privileged groups
   - Enforce MFA for sensitive applications

4. **Set appropriate expirations**
   - Use user expiration for contractors, temps, trials
   - Set group membership expiration for project-based access
   - Monitor and clean up expired accounts regularly

5. **Audit access regularly**
   - Review user roles and permissions quarterly
   - Check group memberships for accuracy
   - Use Assigned Roles/Permissions views for audits
   - Remove unused accounts promptly

### Group Management Security

1. **Define clear group purposes**
   - Document what each group is for
   - Use descriptive names
   - Avoid overlapping group responsibilities

2. **Limit privileged groups**
   - Only mark groups as privileged when truly necessary
   - Audit privileged group membership frequently
   - Require justification for privileged group access

3. **Use namespaces for isolation**
   - Separate production from non-production
   - Isolate departments or projects
   - Enforce namespace boundaries strictly

4. **Control group membership**
   - Require approvals for sensitive group additions
   - Monitor group membership changes in audit logs
   - Set up alerts for privileged group modifications

5. **Review role assignments**
   - Ensure groups have only necessary roles
   - Remove unused role assignments
   - Document why each role is assigned

### Administrative Best Practices

1. **Separation of duties**
   - Don't use your admin account for daily tasks
   - Have separate admin and user accounts
   - Require multiple approvals for sensitive changes

2. **Change management**
   - Test permission changes in non-production first
   - Document all privilege escalations
   - Have rollback plans for group/role changes

3. **Monitoring and alerting**
   - Alert on privileged group membership changes
   - Monitor failed authentication attempts
   - Track bulk user imports/deletions
   - Review event logs for suspicious patterns

4. **Data protection**
   - Don't store sensitive data in user profiles
   - Encrypt PII appropriately
   - Comply with data retention policies
   - Have user data export/deletion procedures (GDPR)

5. **Access reviews**
   - Quarterly access reviews for all users
   - Immediate review when users change roles
   - Annual comprehensive privilege audit
   - Remove access for terminated employees immediately
